This assignment was a reality check for me.
Things I learned is I am good with Flexbox (Check contact page solely made with flex) but need improvement with grid. 
I am unable to distinguish how to properly use Div containers.
More improtantly how to work on grid and flexbox all together.
Going forward I am strengthning my foundations and will do best at Final submission of website
